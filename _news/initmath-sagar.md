On the first Sunday, June 4th, 2023, after a week of the camp, our special visit was arranged to Moonidih Mines (one of India's largest and oldest coal-mine) by our host Prof. S. P. Tiwari Sir. Following are couple of pics one among which shows us dressed and ready for the mono-rail ride inside the inclined mines. -->

MTTS is also known for group discussions, an effective way of learning. In the pictures below, I can be seen assisting students' groups, listening to their problems or having a fun discussions with them. Pictures were cliced by my friend Omkar who was also one of the resident faculty at MTTS and who called me (for these discussions) as "मधुमक्खी का छत्ता"
