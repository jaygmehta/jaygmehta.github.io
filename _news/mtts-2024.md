On early morning of Wednesday, May 29th, 2024, I went to the Siddhi Vinayak Temple with Soma Sir, Satya Sir, and Krishna. At the end of two weeks, on June 1st, we had tree plantation of the two trees gifted by the MTTS Trust to ICT with Ajit Sir, Soma Sir, and Bhowmick Sir near the main gate of the ICT campus.
