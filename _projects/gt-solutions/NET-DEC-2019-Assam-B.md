How many $3$-Sylow subgroups does the symmetric group $S_4$ have?

(a) $8$<br>
(b) $4$<br>
(c) $2$<br>
(d) $1$<br>

**Solution**

By third Sylow theorem, $1+3k \mid 24$. But since $\gcd(1+3k,3)=1$, we have $1+3k \mid 8$. Therefore, $k = 0, 1$. Thus, possibly the number of $3$-Sylow subgroups in $S_4$ is either $1$ or $4$. Since the number of elements or order $3$ (i.e., $3$-cycles) are more than $2$, the number of $3$-Sylow subgroups must be $4$.
