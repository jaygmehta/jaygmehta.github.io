Let $\sigma =(1\ 2)(3\ 4\ 5)$ and $\tau = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6)$ be permutations in $S_6$, the group of permutations on six symbols.  Which of the following statements are true? 

(a) The subgroups $\langle \sigma\rangle$ and $\langle \tau \rangle$ are isomorphic to each other.<br>
(b) $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are conjugate in $S_6$.<br>
(c) $\langle \sigma\rangle \cap \langle \tau \rangle$ is the trivial group<br>
(d) $\sigma$ and $\tau$ commute<br>

**Solution**

(a) Note that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ both are elements of order $6$. Hence, the (cyclic) subgroup generated by them is of order $6$. Since $\mathbb Z_6$ is the unique cyclic group of order $6$, we have
$$\langle \sigma \rangle \approx \mathbb Z_6 \approx \langle \tau \rangle.$$<br>
(b) $\sigma$ and $\tau$ do not have the same cycle decomposition (i.e. their partitions are different). Hence, they are not conjugate to each other.<br>
(c) $\langle \sigma \rangle = \{\sigma, \sigma^2,\sigma^3,\sigma^4,\sigma^5, \sigma^6=e\}$ and $\langle \tau \rangle = \{\tau, \tau^2,\tau^3,\tau^4,\tau^5, \tau^6=e\}$. Note that $\tau^6(6) = 6$ and $\tau^i(6) \neq 6$ for any $i=1,2,3,4,5$, i.e. no power of $\tau$ or no element of $\langle\tau \rangle$ other than $e$ fixes $6$. However, $\sigma(6)=6$ and $\sigma^i(6)=6$ for all $i = 1,\ldots,6$. So $\sigma^i \neq \tau_j$ for any $i,j = 1,2,3,4,5$. Hence, $\langle \sigma\rangle \cap \langle \tau \rangle =\{e\}$.<br>
(d) $\sigma$ and $\tau$ do not commute because $\sigma(\tau(2)) = \sigma(3) = 4$ but $\tau(\sigma(2))=\tau(1) = 2$.
