Which of the following numbers can be orders of permutations $\sigma$ of $11$ symbols such that $\sigma$ does not fix any symbol? 

(a) $18$<br>
(b) $30$<br>
(c) $15$<br>
(d) $28$<br>

**Solution**

We know that every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles and the order of the permutation is the lcm of order of the disjoint cycles in its decomposition. \\
Since here $\sigma \in S_{11}$ does not fix any symbol, there are no $1$-cycles appearing in its decomposition. Now,
$18 = 2+9$ and ${\rm lcm}(2,9)=18$, $\sigma =(1,2) (3,4,\ldots,11) \in S_{11}$ is a permutation of order $18$. Similarly, $30 = 6+5$, $15 = 3+3+5$, and $28=4+7$. Hence, all can be possible options for order 
of $\sigma \in S_{11}$, i.e. all options are correct.
