Determine which of the following cannot be the class equation of a group.

(a) $10=1+1+1+2+5$.<br>
(b) $4=1+1+2$.<br>
(c) $8=1+1+3+3$.<br>
(d) $6=1+2+3$.<br>

**Solution**

(a) In this case, $o(Z(G))=3$ this is not possible as here $o(Z(G)) \nmid o(G)=10$. Therefore it \textbf{cannot be} the class equation of $G$ and hence the statement is true.<br>
(b) Here $3$ appears in the class equation which does not divide $o(G)=8$. So this \textbf{cannot be} the class equation and hence this option is true.<br>
(c) Here $o(Z(G))=2$ and $o(G)=4$. Every group of order $4$ is abelian and hence $G=Z(G)$. So this case is also *not possible*.<br>
(d) This is a possible option. In fact, it is the class equation of $S_3$.
