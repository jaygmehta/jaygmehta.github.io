For a positive integer $n\ge 4$ and a prime number $p\le n$, let $U_{p,n}$ denote the union of all $p$-Sylow subgroups of the alternating group $A_n$ on $n$ letters. Also let $K_{p,n}$ denote the subgroup of $A_n$ generated by $U_{p,n}$, and let $|K_{p,n}|$ denote the order of $K_{p,n}$. Then 

(a) $|K_{2,4}|=12$<br>
(b) $|K_{2,4}|=4$<br>
(c) $|K_{2,5}|=60$<br>
(d) $|K_{3,5}|=30$<br>

**Solution**

(a) This option is incorrect (reason given below).<br>
(b) We know that 
\begin{align*}
A_4= &\ \{e, (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3), \\
&\ \quad (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,2,4), (1,4,2), (1,3,4), (1,4,3), (2,3,4), (2,4,3) \}
\end{align*}
and it has a unique $2$-Sylow subgroup (of order $4$). Hence 
$$U_{2,4} = K_{2,4} = \{e, (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3)\}.$$
Therefore $|K_{2,4}| = 4$. Option (b) is correct while (a) is incorrect.<br>
(c) $A_5$ contains permutations with decompositions $5$, $3+1+1$, $2+2+1$, and $1+1+1+1+1$ of which elements of order $2$ are of the form $2+2+1$. There is no element of order $4$ in $A_5$. Hence, $U_{2,5}$ is the union of elements with cycle decomposition $2+2+1$ and identity $e$. Note that any $3$-cycle can be written as product of two permutations of the form $2+2+1$ as follows:
$$(i,j,k) = \underbrace{(i, j)(k,m)}_{\sigma}\underbrace{(m,k)(i,k)}_{\theta}.$$
Also, any $5$-cycle can be written as a product of $3$-cycles as:
$$(i,j,k,l,m) = (i,j,k)(k,l,m).$$
Hence, every element of $A_5$ is generated by permutations of the form $2+2+1$ (i.e. elements of $U_{2,5}$). Therefore $K_{2,5}=A_5$, i.e. $|K_{2,5}|=60$. So this option is correct.<br>
(d) As above, $U_{3,5}$ contains elements of the form $3+1+1$. $K_{3,5}$ will contain all the $5$-cycles as we have seen above that a $5$-cycle can be generated by multiplying two $3$-cycles. Also, any element of the form $2+2+1$ can be written as a product of $3$-cycles as:
$$(i,j)(k,l) = (i,j,k)(k,i,l).$$
Therefore $K_{3,5}=A_5$, i.e. $|K_{3,5}|=60$. So this option is incorrect.
