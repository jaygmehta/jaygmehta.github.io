Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group on $n$ symbols. The group $S_3 \oplus (\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z)$ is isomorphic to which of the following groups?

(a) $\mathbb Z/12\, \mathbb Z$<br>
(b) $(\mathbb Z/6\, \mathbb Z) \oplus (\mathbb Z/2\, \mathbb Z)$<br>
(c) $A_4$, the alternating group of order $12$<br>
(d) $D_6$, dihedral group of order $12$<br>

**Solution**

(a) $S_3$ is non-abelian so this is not possible.<br>
(b) $S_3$ is non-abelian so this is not possible.<br>
(c) $(\psi,1)$ has order $6$ in the given group but $A_4$ has no element of order $6$. So they cannot be isomorphic.<br>
(d) Last option left is correct.
