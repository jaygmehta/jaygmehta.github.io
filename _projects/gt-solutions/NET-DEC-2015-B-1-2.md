A group generated by $G$ of elements $x,y$ with the relations $x^3=y^2=(xy)^2 = 1$. The order of $G$ is

(a) $4$<br>
(b) $6$<br>
(c) $8$<br>
(d) $12$<br>

**Solution**

Clearly $G$ is non abelian, because if $x$ and $y$ commute, then $o(xy) = 6$ but here $(xy)^2 =1$.\\
Since $(xy)^2=1$, $xyxy=1 \Rightarrow yxyxy = y \Rightarrow yxyxy^2 = y^2 \Rightarrow yxyx = 1 \Rightarrow (yx)^2=1$. Also $x^{-1} = x^2$ and $y^{-1} = y$. \\
Also, $x^3y^2 = 1 = xyxy \Rightarrow x^2y = yx$. Similarly, $yx^2 = xy$.
The group $G = \{1,x,x^2,y,xy,yx\}$ which is nothing but $S_3$. The order is $6$.
