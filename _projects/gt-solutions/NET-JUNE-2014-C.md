Consider the multiplicative group $G$ of all the (complex) $2^n$-th roots of unity, where $n=0,1,2,\ldots$. Then

(a) Every subgroup of $G$ is finite<br>
(b) $G$ has a finite set of generators<br>
(c) $G$ is cyclic<br>
(d) Every finite subgroup of $G$ is cyclic<br>

**Solution**

We know that $n$-th root of unity are of the form $e^{\frac{2\pi i k}{n}}$, where $k=0,1,2,\ldots, n-1$.<br>

(a) $G$ itself is a subgroup of $G$ which is infinite. But if we consider only proper subgroups of $G$, then this option is true.<br>
(b) If $G$ is generated by a finite set $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots, \alpha_k\}$, where $\alpha_i$ are $2^{n_i}$-th roots of unity for $i=1,2,\ldots,k$. Take $N = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots+n_k$. Then $(\alpha_i)^{2^N} = 1$ for all $i$. Then $2^m$-th root of unity, where $m > N$, cannot be generated by the given finite set. Hence, $G$ cannot have a finite set of generators.<br>
(c) If $G = \langle \alpha \rangle$, where $\alpha$ is a $2^m$-th root of unity, then $G$ is a finite group and $2^{m+1}$-th root of unity cannot be generated by $\alpha$ (i.e. powers of $\alpha$). Hence, $G$ cannot be cyclic.<br>
(d) Let $H$ be a finite subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb C^*$, $H$ is also a (finite) subgroup of $\mathbb C^*$. We know that every finite subgroup (of order $n$) of $\mathbb C^*$ are cyclic, which are precisely the $n$-th roots of unity. Hence, $H$ is cyclic and this option is true.
