The number of group homomorphisms from the alternating group $A_5$ to the symmetric group $S_4$ is

(a) $1$<br>
(b) $12$<br>
(c) $20$<br>
(d) $6$<br>

**Solution**

Let $f: A_5 \to S_4$ be a homomorphism. Then $\ker f$ is a normal subgroup of $A_5$ and $A_5/\ker f$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$. We know that $A_5$ is simple and so it has no proper normal subgroups. So only possibilities for $\ker f = \{e\}$ or $\ker f = A_5$.\\
If $\ker f = \{e\}$, then $A_5/\ker f$ has order $60$ and it cannot be isomorphic to any subgroup of $S_4$ as $o(S_4)=24$.\\
If $\ker f = A_5$, then we get trivial homomorphism. Thus, there is exactly one (trivial) homomorphism from $A_5$ to $S_4$.
