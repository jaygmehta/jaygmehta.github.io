If $x,y$ and $z$ are elements of a group such that $xyz=1$, then 

(a) $yzx=1$.<br>
(b) $yxz=1$.<br>
(c) $zxy=1$.<br>
(d) $zyx=1$.<br>

**Solution**

(a) Since $xyz=1$, $x^{-1} = yz $ also is an element of the group. Multiplying by $x$ on right we get, $yzx=1$.<br>
(b) In Quaternion group $Q_8$ take $x=i$, $y=j$ and $z=-k$. Then $xyz = (ij)(-k) = -k^2 =1$. But $yxz=ji(-k) = (-k)(-k) = k^2 = -1 \neq 1$.<br>
(c) Since $xyz=1$, $z^{-1} = xy $ also is an element of the group. Multiplying by $z$ on left we get, $zxy=1$.<br>
(d) In Quaternion group $Q_8$ take $x=i$, $y=j$ and $z=-k$. Then $xyz = (ij)(-k) = -k^2 =1$. But $zyx=(-k)ji = (-k)(-k) = k^2 = -1 \neq 1$.
