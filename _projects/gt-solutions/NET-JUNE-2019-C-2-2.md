For any prime $p$ consider group $G = GL_2(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)$. Then which of the following are true?

(a) $G$ has an element of order $p$<br>
(b) $G$ has exactly one element of order $p$<br>
(c) $G$ has no $p$-Sylow subgroup<br>
(d) Every element of order $p$ is conjugate to a matrix $\begin{pmatrix}
             1 & a \\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$, where $a \in (\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^*$<br>

**Solution**

(a) We know that $o(GL_2(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)) = (p^2-1)(p^2-p) = p(p^2-1)(p-1)$. By Cauchy's theorem, $G$ has an element of order $p$.<br>

(b) Since $G$ has an element of order $p$, the cyclic subgroup generated by that element has $p-1$ elements of order $p$. So this option is **incorrect**.<br>

(c) Sylow's first theorem guarantees the existence of a $p$-Sylow subgroup in $G$ if $p \mid o(G)$. So this option is **incorrect**.<br>

(d) Note that the order of a $p$-Sylow subgroup in $G$ is $p$ (since $p\mid o(G)$ but $p^2 \nmid o(G)$). Now $\begin{pmatrix}
1 & a\\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$ has order $p$ (Verfiy! since $a \in (\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^*$). So, the subgroup generated by $\begin{pmatrix}
1 & a\\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$ is of order $p$ which is a $p$-Sylow subgroup, say $P_2$. Any element of order $p$, generates a subgroup of order $p$ which is also a $p$-Sylow subgroup, say $P_1$. By Second Sylow theorem, $P_2 = xP_1 x^{-1}$ for some $x \in G$ (any two $p$-Sylow subgroups are conjugate). Therefore, any element of order $p$ (in $P_1$) is conjugate to the matrix $\begin{pmatrix}
1 & a\\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \in P_2$.
