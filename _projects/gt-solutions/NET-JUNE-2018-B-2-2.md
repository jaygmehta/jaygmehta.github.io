Let $S_7$ denote the group of permutations of the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$. Which of the following is true?

(a) There are no elements of order $6$ in $S_7$<br>
(b) There are no elements of order $7$ in $S_7$<br>
(c) There are no elements of order $8$ in $S_7$<br>
(d) There are no elements of order $10$ in $S_7$<br>

**Solution**

(a) A $6$-cycle in $S_7$ has order $6$.

(b) A $7$-cycle in $S_7$ has order $7$.

(c) We know that order of a permutation is lcm of the length of disjoint cycles in its expression. There is no partition of $7$ which gives lcm $8$. Hence, the statement is correct.

(d) $(1,2)(3,4,5,6,7) \in S_7$ is of the form $5+2$ and its order is lcm$(5,2) = 10$.
