What is the cardinality of the set $\{z \in \mathbb C \mid z^{98} = 1 \text{ and } z^n \neq 1 \text{ for any } 0 < n < 98\}$?

(a) $0$<br>
(b) $12$<br>
(c) $42$<br>
(d) $49$<br>

**Solution**

The set $\{z \in \mathbb C \mid z^{98} = 1 \text{ and } z^n \neq 1 \text{ for any } 0 < n < 98\}$ is the set of generators of a cyclic subgroup of $(\mathbb C^*,\cdot)$, which is precisely, the $98$-th roots of unity. \\
Its cardinality is the number of generators of the subgroup of $98$-th roots of unity, i.e. $\phi(98) = \phi(2)\phi(49) = 1 \times (7^2 - 7) = 42$.
