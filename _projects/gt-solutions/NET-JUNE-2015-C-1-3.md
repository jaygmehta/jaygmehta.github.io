Which of the following cannot be the class equation of a group of order $10$?

(a) $1+1+1+2+5=10$.<br>
(b) $1+2+3+4=10$.<br>
(c) $1+2+2+5=10$.<br>
(d) $1+1+2+2+2+2=10$.<br>

**Solution**

(a) In this case, $o(Z(G))=3$ this is not possible as here $o(Z(G)) \nmid o(G)=10$. Therefore it \textbf{cannot be} the class equation of $G$ and hence the statement is true.<br>
(b) Here $3$ and $4$ appear in the class equation which does not divide $o(G)=10$. So this \textbf{cannot be} the class equation and hence this option is true.<br>
(c) This is a possible case of class equation of a group $G$ of order $10$. In fact, it is the class equation of Dihedral group $D_5$ which is non-abelian.<br>
(d) Here $o(Z(G))=2$ and so $o(G/Z(G))=5$. Then $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic and therefore $G$ must be abelian. But in that case $o(G)=o(Z(G))=10$. This is is also not a possibility of the class equation of $G$.
