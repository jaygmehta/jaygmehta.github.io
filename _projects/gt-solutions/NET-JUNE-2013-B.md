Let $G$ be a simple group of order $168$. What is the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $7$? 

(a) $1$<br>
(b) $7$<br>
(c) $8$<br>
(d) $28$<br>

**Solution**

$168= 2^3 \times 3 \times 7$. Therefore the number of subgroups of order $7$ (i.e. $7$-Sylow subgroups) is of the form $1+7k$. Hence the possibilities are $1, 8, 15, 22, \ldots$. Since $G$ is simple, $1$ is not possible. Looking at the options, the answer is $8$.\\
The exact number can be precisely computed using Sylow's theorem also.
