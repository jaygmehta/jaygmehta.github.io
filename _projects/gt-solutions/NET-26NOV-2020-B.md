Let $X$ be a non-empty set and $P(X)$ be the set of all subsets of $X$. On $P(X)$, define two operations $*$ and $\Delta$ as follows: for $A, B \in P(X)$, $A * B = A \cap B$; $A \Delta B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$.\\
Which of the following statements is true?

(a) $P(X)$ is a group under $*$ as well as under $\Delta$<br>
(b) $P(X)$ is a group under $*$ but not under $\Delta$<br>
(c) $P(X)$ is a group under $\Delta$ but not under $*$<br>
(d) $P(X)$ is neither a group under $*$ nor under $\Delta$<br>

**Solution**

$P(X)$ is not a group under intersection as $X$ is the identity but there is no inverse. Show that $P(X)$ is a group under the symmetric difference $\Delta$.
