For $n \ge 1$, let $\left(\mathbb Z/n \mathbb Z\right)^*$ be the group of units of $\left(\mathbb Z/n \mathbb Z\right)$. Which of the following groups are cyclic?

(a) $\left(\mathbb Z/10 \mathbb Z\right)^*$<br>
(b) $\left(\mathbb Z/2^3 \mathbb Z\right)^*$<br>
(c) $\left(\mathbb Z/100 \mathbb Z\right)^*$<br>
(d) $\left(\mathbb Z/163 \mathbb Z\right)^*$<br>

**Solution**

We know that, the group of units in $\mathbb Z_n$ is denoted by $U_n$ or $U(n)$ (or sometimes by $\left(\mathbb Z/n \mathbb Z\right)^*$). This group $U_n$ is cyclic if and only if $n=2,4, p^k$ or $2p^k$ for an odd prime $p$.

(a) Here, $n=10 = 2 \times 5^1$. Hence, $U_{10}$ is cyclic.<br>
(b) $n=2^3$ is not of the form stated in the above result and hence $U_8$ is not cyclic.<br>
(c) $n=100 = 2^2 \times 5^2$ is not of the form stated above and hence $UU_{100}$ is not cyclic.<br>
(d) $n= 163$ is itself a prime (odd). Hence $U_{163}$ is cyclic.
