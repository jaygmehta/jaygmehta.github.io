Upto isomorphism, the number of abelian groups of order $108$ is 

(a) $12$<br>
(b) $9$<br>
(c) $6$<br>
(d) $5$<br>

**Solution**

We know that the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order ${p_1}^{\alpha_1}{p_2}^{\alpha_2}\cdots {p_r}^{\alpha_r}$ is $p(\alpha_1)p(\alpha_2) \cdots p(\alpha_r)$, where $p(n)$ denotes the partition of $n$ and $p_i$'s are distinct primes.\\
Here $108=2^2\times 3^3$. Hence the number of  non-isomorphic abelian groups of order $108$ is $p(2)p(3)=2 \times 3 = 6$.
