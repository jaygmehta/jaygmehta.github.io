The total number of non-isomorphic groups of order $122$ is 

(a) $2$<br>
(b) $1$<br>
(c) $61$<br>
(d) $4$<br>

**Solution**

We know that, if $p\mid (q-1)$ then there is a unique non-abelian group of order $pq$.\\% If $p\nmid (q-1)$ the group of order $pq$ is cyclic and hence abelian.
$122=2 \times 61$ and $2 \mid 60$ and hence there is a unique non-abelian group of order $122$. Now, we find the number of abelian groups of order $122$.\\
We know that the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order ${p_1}^{\alpha_1}{p_2}^{\alpha_2}\cdots {p_r}^{\alpha_r}$ is $p(\alpha_1)p(\alpha_2) \cdots p(\alpha_r)$, where $p(n)$ denotes the partition of $n$ and $p_i$'s are distinct primes.\\
Here $122=2^1\times {61}^1$. Hence the number of  non-isomorphic abelian groups of order $122$ is $p(1)p(1)=1$ which is $Z_{122}$. Hence, in all, there are $2$ non-isomorphic groups of order $122$.
