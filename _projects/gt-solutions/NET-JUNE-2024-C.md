Which of the following numbers are order of some elements of the symmetric group $S_n$?

(a) $3$<br>
(b) $4$<br>
(c) $5$<br>
(d) $6$<br>

**Solution**

We know that if $\theta \in S_n$ can be written as disjoint cycles $\theta = \theta_1 \theta_2 \cdots \theta_r$, then $o(\theta) = {\rm lcm}(l(\theta_1),\ldots, l(\theta_r)$, where $l(\theta_i) = o(\theta_i)$ is the length of the cycle $\theta_i$.\\
Here, in $S_5$, any $3$, $4$, and $5$ cycle has order $3$, $4$, and $5$, respectively. Also, a permutation of the form $(a,b)(c,d,e) \in S_5$, i.e., having decomposition $5=2+3$ has order ${\rm lcm}(2,3) = 6$. Thus, all four options are correct.
