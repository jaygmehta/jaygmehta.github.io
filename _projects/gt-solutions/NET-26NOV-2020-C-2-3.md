Let $SL_2(\mathbb Z) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\ c & d
\end{pmatrix} \in M_2(\mathbb Z) : ad - bc = 1\right\}$ and for any prime $p$, let 
$$\Gamma(p) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\ c & d
\end{pmatrix} \in SL_2(\mathbb Z) \mid a,d \equiv 1 \pmod p, bc \equiv 0 \pmod p\right\}.$$
Which of the following are true?

(a) $\Gamma(p)$ is a subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$<br>
(b) $\Gamma(p)$ is not a normal subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$<br>
(c) $\Gamma(p)$ has atleast two elements<br>
(d) $\Gamma(p)$ is uncountable<br>

**Solution**

Since $M_2(\mathbb Z)$ is countable, $\Gamma(p)$ is countable. Show that $\Gamma(p)$ is a normal subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$. Clearly $\Gamma(p)$ has at least two elements. In fact, it has infinitely many elements.
