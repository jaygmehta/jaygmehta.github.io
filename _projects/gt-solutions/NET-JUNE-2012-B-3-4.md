Let $\mathbb F$ be a field of $8$ elements and $A=\{x \in \mathbb F \mid x^7 = 1 \text{ and } x^k \neq 1 \text{ for all natural numbers } k < 7\}$. Then the number of elements in $A$ is

(a) $1$<br>
(b) $2$<br>
(c) $3$<br>
(d) $6$<br>

**Solution**

We know that $\mathbb F^* = \mathbb F \smallsetminus \{0\}$ is the multiplicative group of the field $\mathbb F$ and here it is a cyclic group of order $7$ since field has $8$ elements. The number of elements of $\mathbb F$ with order $7$ and not less (or the number of generators of this group) is $\phi(7) = 6$.
