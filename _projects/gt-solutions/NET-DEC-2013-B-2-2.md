How many normal subgroups does a non-abelian group $G$ of order $21$ have other than the identity subgroup $\{e\}$ and $G$? 

(a) $0$<br>
(b) $1$<br>
(c) $3$<br>
(d) $7$<br>

**Solution**

The only possibilities of proper subgroups of $G$ are of order $3$ and $7$.\\
$1+7 \lambda \mid 21$ or $1+7 \lambda \mid 3$ implies $\lambda =0$ and hence $G$ has a unique $7$-Sylow subgroup which will be normal. Thus, $G$ has only $6$ elements out of $21$ which are of order $7$. Hence the $4$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ cannot be unique and hence not normal.\\
So $G$ has only one proper normal subgroup.
