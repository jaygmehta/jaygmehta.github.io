Let $G$ be a non-abelian group. Then, its order can be:

(a) $25$<br>
(b) $55$<br>
(c) $125$<br>
(d) $35$<br>

**Solution**

(a) For a prime $p$, every group of order $p^2$ is abelian. Hence, every group of order $25=5^2$ is abelian.<br>
(b) We know that, if $p\mid (q-1)$ then there is a unique non-abelian group of order $pq$. Since $5 \mid 10=11-1$, there is a non-abelian group of order $55$.<br>
(c) A group of order $p^3$, for a prime $p$, may be non-abelian and hence group of order $125$ need not necessarily be abelian.<br>
(d) We know that, if $p\nmid (q-1)$ the group of order $pq$ is cyclic and hence abelian. Since $5\nmid 7-1=6$, a group of order $35$ is cyclic and hence abelian.
