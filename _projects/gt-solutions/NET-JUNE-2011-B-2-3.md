Let $G$ be a group of order $77$. Then center of $G$ is isomorphic to  

(a) $\mathbb Z$<br>
(b) $\mathbb Z_7$<br>
(c) $\mathbb Z_{11}$<br>
(d) $\mathbb Z_{77}$<br>

**Solution**

We know that any group of order $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes such that $p < q$ and $p \nmid q$, is cyclic and hence abelian. Therefore any group of order $77$ is abelian and for abelian group $G$, $G=Z(G)$. Thus, its center is (itself) cyclic group with order $77$, i.e. it is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_{77}$. Hence, option (d) is correct.
