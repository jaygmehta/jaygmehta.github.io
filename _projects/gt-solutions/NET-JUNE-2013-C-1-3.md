Consider the two sets $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Choose the correct statements. 

(a) The total number of functions from $A$ to $B$ is $125$<br>
(b) The total number of functions from $A$ to $B$ is $243$<br>
(c) The total number of one-one functions from $A$ to $B$ is $60$<br>
(d) The total number of one-one functions from $A$ to $B$ is $120$<br>

**Solution**

(a) The possibilities for image of $1$ are $5$, for image of $2$ are $5$ and for image of $3$ are $5$. Hence, total number of such functions are $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$. This option is correct.<br>
(b) Above option is correct and hence this option is not correct.<br>
(c) Due to one-one-ness the possibilities for image of $1$ are $5$, for image of $2$ are $4$ and for image of $3$ are $3$. Hence, total number of such functions are $5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60$. This option is correct.<br>
(d) Above option is correct and hence this option is not correct.
