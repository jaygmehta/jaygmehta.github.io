Let $G$ be a group of order $125$. Which of the following statements are necessarily true?

(a) $G$ has a non-trivial abelian subgroup.<br>
(b) The center of $G$ is a proper subgroup.<br>
(c) The center of $G$ has order $5$.<br>
(d) There is a subgroup of order $25$.<br>

**Solution**

(a) Since $5 \mid o(G)$ by Cauchy's theorem, $G$ has an element, say $a$, of order $5$. The subgroup generated by $a$ is non-trivial abelian (in fact cyclic) subgroup of $G$.\\
Also $o(G)=5^3$. Therefore $Z(G) \neq \{e\}$. Thus, the center of group $Z(G)$ itself is also a non-trivial abelian group of $G$.

(b) If $G$ is abelian group (for example $G= \mathbb Z_{125}$ or $G=\mathbb Z_{25} \times \mathbb Z_5$), then $G=Z(G)$. Thus, center need not be necessarily a proper subgroup of $G$.

(c) If $G$ is abelian, then $G=Z(G)$. Thus, center need not necessarily have order $5$.

(d) Sylow's theorem states that if $p^\alpha \mid o(G)$ for a prime $p$ and any positive integer $\alpha$. Then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^\alpha$. Here $5^2 \mid o(G)=125$. Therefore, $G$ has a subgroup of order $25$.
