Let $G$ be a group of order $2020$. Which of the following statements is necessarily true?

(a) $G$ is not a simple group<br>
(b) $G$ has exactly four proper subgroups<br>
(c) $G$ is a cyclic group<br>
(d) $G$ is abelian<br>

**Solution**

Note that $2020 = 4 \times 5 \times 101$. The number of $101$-Sylow subgroup divides $20$ and hence it must be unique. Therefore, $G$ cannot be simple.
