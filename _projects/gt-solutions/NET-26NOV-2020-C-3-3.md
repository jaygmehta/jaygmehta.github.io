Which of the following statements are true?

(a) $\mathbb Q$ has countably many subgroups<br>
(b) $\mathbb Q$ has uncountably many subsets<br>
(c) Every finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb Q$ is cyclic<br>
(d) $\mathbb Q$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Q \times \mathbb Q$ as groups<br>

**Solution**

Note that $\mathbb Q$ has uncountably subgroups (Find a proof!).\\
For every real number $x$, there is a sequence of rationals converging to $x$. Consider the set of points of all such sequences. Since $\mathbb R$ is uncountable, $\mathbb Q$ has uncountably many subsets.\\
Let $G = \langle r_1, r_2,\ldots, r_n\rangle$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb Q$. Let $r_i = \frac{a_i}{b_i}$ and let $s =\frac{1}{b_1\cdots b_n}$. Then we claim that $G < \langle s \rangle$. Note that $r_i = \frac{a_i}{b_i} = [a_i (b_1 \cdots b_{i-1}b_{i+1}\cdots b_n)] s$. Thus, $r_i \in \langle s \rangle$ and hence $G$ is a subgroup of cyclic group $\langle s \rangle$. Since subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic, $G$ is cyclic.\\
Let $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z = \langle (1,0), (0,1)\rangle$ be the finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb Q \times \mathbb Q$. But $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ is not cyclic (Show!). On the other hand, every finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb Q$ is cyclic. Hence, $\mathbb Q$ cannot be isomorphic to $\mathbb Q \times \mathbb Q$.
