Let $p$ be a prime. Pick each correct statement from below. Up to isomorphism

(a) there are exactly two abelian groups of order $p^2$.<br>
(b) there are exactly two groups of order $p^2$.<br>
(c) there are exactly two commutative rings of order $p^2$.<br>
(d) there is exactly one integral domain of order $p^2$.<br>

**Solution**

(a) The number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order $p^n$, where $p$ is prime, is $p(n)$ i.e. partition of $n$. Here $n=2$ and $p(2)=2$. Thus, there are exactly two non-isomorphic abelian groups of order $p^2$.<br>

(b) We know that, every group of order $p^2$ is abelian. Then by above, there are exactly two non-isomorphic abelian groups of order $p^2$ (and they are $\mathbb Z_{p^2}$ and $\mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z_p$).<br>

(c) $\mathbb Z_{p^2}$, $\mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z_p$ and $\mathbb F_{p^2}$ are at least three rings or order $p^2$. So this is not true.<br>

(d) Any finite integral domain is a field and any two finite fields with same number of elements are isomorphic. Hence there is exactly one integral domain of order $p^2$.
