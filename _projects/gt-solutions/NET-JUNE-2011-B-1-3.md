Consider a group $G$. Let $Z(G)$ be its center, i.e. $Z(G) =\{g \in G \mid gh = hg \text{ for all } h\in G\}$. For $n \in \mathbb N$, the set of positive integers, define
$$J_n = \{(g_1,\ldots,g_n) \in Z(G) \times \cdots \times Z(G) \mid g_1\cdots g_n = e\}.$$
As a subset of the direct product group $G\times \cdots \times G$ ($n$ times direct product of the group $G$), $J_n$ is

(a) Not necessarily a subgroup<br>
(b) A subgroup but not necessarily a normal subgroup<br>
(c) A normal subgroup<br>
(d) Isomorphic to the direct product $Z(G) \times Z(G) \times \cdots \times Z(G)$ ($(n-1)$ times).<br>

**Solution**

It can be easily checked that $J_n$ is a subgroup. Being a subgroup of an abelian group $Z(G)\times \cdots \times Z(G)$, it is normal. Hence option (c) is correct.
