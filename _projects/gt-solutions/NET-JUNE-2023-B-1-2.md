Which of the following equation can occur as the class equation of a group of order $10$?

(a) $10=1+1+\cdots + 1$ ($10$ times)<br>
(b) $10=1+1+2+2+2+2$<br>
(c) $10=1+1+1+2+5$<br>
(d) $10=1+2+3+4$<br>

**Solution**

The first one $10= 1+1+\cdots + 1$ ($10$ times) is a class equation of an abelian group of order $10$ (i.e., $\mathbb Z_{10}$).\\
We know that if $o(G) = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes such that $p< q$ and $p \nmid q-1$. Then $G$ is the unique non-abelian group of order $pq$. In this case $o(Z) = 1$ as it cannot be any prime (otherwise $G$ will be abelian). 
This shows that option (b) and (c) are not correct. Option (d) is also not correct as $3 \nmid 10$, so it can also not be the class equation.
