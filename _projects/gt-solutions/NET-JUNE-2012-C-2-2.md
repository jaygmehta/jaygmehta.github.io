For any group $G$ of order $36$ and any subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $4$ 

(a) $H \subset Z(G)$<br>
(b) $H = Z(G)$<br>
(c) $H$ is normal in $G$<br>
(d) $H$ is an abelian group<br>

**Solution**

(a) For $G = S_3 \times S_3$, $Z(G) = \{(e,e)\}$. So this option is incorrect.<br>
(b) For $G = \mathbb Z_6 \times \mathbb{Z}_6$, $Z(G) = G$. So this option is incorrect.<br>
(c) For $G = \mathbb Z_6 \times S_3$, the subgroups $H = \{0,3\} \times \{e,\phi\}$ and $K = \{0,3\} \times \{e,\phi \psi\}$ are both of order $4$ and they are $2$-Sylow subgroups of $G$. Thus, a $2$-Sylow subgroup in $G$ is not unique and hence it cannot be normal.<br>
(d) We know that every group of order $4$ is abelian and hence this option is correct.
