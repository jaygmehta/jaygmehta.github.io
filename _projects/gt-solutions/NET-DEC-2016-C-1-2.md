Let $\mathbb C$ be the field of complex numbers and $\mathbb C^*$ be the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication. Then which of the following are true?

(a) $\mathbb C^*$ is cyclic.<br>
(b) Every finite subgroup of $\mathbb C^*$ is cyclic.<br>
(c) $\mathbb C^*$ has finitely many subgroups.<br>
(d) Every proper subgroup of $\mathbb C^*$ is cyclic.<br>

**Solution**

(a) $\mathbb C^*$ is not cyclic. We know that an infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $(\mathbb Z,+)$. %This is not true, since $\mathbb C^*$ has an element of order $3$ while $\mathbb Z$ has no such element.
There cannot be isomorphism between them as one is uncountable and other is countable. So there is no one-one map.

(b) Let $H$ be a finite subgroup of $\mathbb C^*$ of order $n$. Then $z^n = 1$ for all $z \in H$. Thus, $H$ is the subgroup of $n$-th roots of unity, which we know is cyclic. Hence this is true.

(c) $\mathbb C^*$ has infinitely many subgroups $H_n$, where $H_n$ is the subgroup of $n$-th roots of unity for every $n$.

(d) $(\mathbb Q^*,\cdot)$ and $(\mathbb R^*,\cdot)$ are proper subgroups of $\mathbb C^*$ which are not cyclic.
