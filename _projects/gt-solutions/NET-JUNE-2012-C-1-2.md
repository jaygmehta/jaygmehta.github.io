Let $G$ denote the group $S_4 \times S_3$. Then 

(a) a $2$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal <br>
(b) a $3$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal <br>
(c) $G$ has a non-trivial normal subgroup<br>
(d) $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $72$<br>

**Solution**

(a) The order of a $2$-Sylow subgroup of $S_4 \times S_3$ is $16$. Let $\sigma \in S_4$ be a $4$ cycle (i.e. an element of order $4$). Then the subgroups $H = \langle \sigma\rangle \times \{e, \phi\}$ and $K = \langle \sigma \rangle \times \{e, \phi \psi\}$ are both $2$-Sylow subgroups (of order $16$) of $G$. Since a $2$-Sylow subgroup is not unique it cannot be normal.<br>
(b) Same as above, $H=\langle \sigma_1\rangle \times \{e,\psi,\psi^2\}$ and $K = H=\langle \sigma_2\rangle \times \{e,\psi,\psi^2\}$ are two $3$-Sylow subgroups, where $\sigma_1 =(1,2,3) \in S_4$ and $\sigma_2=(1,3,4) \in S_4$ are elements of order $3$. Hence a $3$-Sylow subgroup is not normal (being not unique).<br>
(c) Note that $A_4 \times S_3$ and $S_4 \times \{e,\psi,\psi^2\}$ are normal in $G$ of order $72$. Hence, $G$ has a proper normal subgroup (again of order $72$ and hence next option is also correct).<br>
(d) Same as option (c).
