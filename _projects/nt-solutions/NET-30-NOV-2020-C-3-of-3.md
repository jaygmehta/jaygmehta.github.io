Let $\mathbb N = \{1,2,\ldots\}$ denote the set
of positive integers. For $n \in \mathbb N$, let

$$A_n = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb N^3 : x^n + y^n = z^n \text{ and } z< n\}.$$

Let $F_n$ be the cardinality of the set $A_n$. Which of the following
statements are true?

(a) $F(n)$ is finite for $n \ge 3$<br>
(b) $F(2) = \infty$<br>
(c) $F(n) = 0$ for all $n$<br>
(d) $F(n)$ is non zero for some $n > 2$<br>

**Solution**

1.  Fermat's last theorem: There are no positive integer solutions to
    $x^n + y^n = z^n$ for $n \ge 3$. So $F(n) = 0$ for $n \ge 3$, which
    is a finite number.<br>

2.  For $F(2)$, since $z < 2$, we look for $x, y \in \mathbb N$ such
    that $x^2+y^2 = 1$. This is not possible as $x, y >0$. So
    $F(2) = 0$.<br>

3.  Since $F(n) = 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$, this option is correct.<br>

4.  This is not possible, by Fermat's last theorem.<br>
