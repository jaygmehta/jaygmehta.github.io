The difference between the squares of two
consecutive integers is $408235$. The sum of the numbers is

(a) $16324$<br>
(b) $27061$<br>
(c) $180235$<br>
(d) $408235$<br>

**Solution**

The difference between two squares is $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$. Let
$a = n+1$ and $b=n$ be two consecutive numbers. Then we are given that
$a^2 - b^2 = (n+1 - n) (n+1 + n) = 408235$. Thus,
$2n+1 = a + b = 408235$.
