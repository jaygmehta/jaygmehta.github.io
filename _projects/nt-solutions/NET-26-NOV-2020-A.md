The sum of first $n$ even integers is

(a) divisible by $n$ and not $n+1$<br>
(b) divisible by $n+1$ and not $n$<br>
(c) divisible by both $n$ and $n+1$<br>
(d) neither divisible by $n$ nor by $n+1$<br>

**Solution**

$$2 + 4 + 6 + \cdots + 2n = 2 (1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n) = 2 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1).$$
