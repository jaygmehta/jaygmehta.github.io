The number of positive divisors of $50000$ is

(a) $20$.<br>
(b) $30$.<br>
(c) $40$.<br>
(d) $50$.<br>

**Solution**

If $n={p_1}^{\alpha_1} {p_2}^{\alpha_2} \cdots {p_k}^{\alpha_k}$ and
$d \mid n$ then $d$ is of the form
$d = {p_1}^{\beta_1} {p_2}^{\beta_2} \cdots {p_k}^{\beta_k}$, where
$0 \le \beta_i \le \alpha_i$ for all $i = 1,2,\ldots,k$. Thus, the
number of positive divisors of $n$ is
$(\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2 +1)\cdots (\alpha_k+1)$.<br>

Here, $50000= 2^4 \times 5^5$ and therefore the number of positive
divisors of $50000$ is $(4+1)(5+1) = 5\cdot 6 =30$.
