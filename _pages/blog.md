Welcome to my personal page!

Hi, My name is Jay Mehta. I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics, [Sardar Patel University](https://www.spuvvn.edu/), Vallabh Vidyanagar, India since 2016. Before joining the university, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.imsc.res.in/), Chennai, India. I did my PhD from [Harish-Chandra Research Institute](https://www.hri.res.in/), Prayagraj (Allahabad), India.

**Other interests**

Apart of Mathematics, my interests are: Computers (general and programming, tex-ing), listening music, especially instrumentals and playing piano/keyboard. I learned playing keyboard by myself and a bit from youtube during my PhD and have absolutely no formal knowledge in playing piano. I play piano by ear. In my leisure, I play Hindi (bollywood) songs on keyboard and sometimes upload the videos of me playing on my youtube channel.
