	abstract={
	To study point groups, their irreducible characters are essential. The table of irreducible characters of the icosahedral group $A_5$ is usually obtained by using its duality to the dodecahedral group. It seems that there is no literature which gives a routine computational way to complete it. In the works of Harter and Allen, a computational method is given and the character table up to the tetrahedral group $A_4$ using the group algebra table and linear algebra. In this paper, we employ their method with the aid of computer programming to complete the table. The method is applicable to any other more complicated groups.

abstract={We shall establish an explicit formula for the Davenport series in terms of trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, where by the Davenport series we mean an infinite series involving a PNT (Prime Number Theorem) related to arithmetic function an with the periodic Bernoulli polynomial weight (Formula presented.) and PNT arithmetic functions include the von Mangoldt function, Möbius function and Liouville function, etc. The Riesz sum of order 0 or 1 gives the well-known explicit formula for respectively the partial sum or the Riesz sum of order 1 of PNT functions. Then we may reveal the genesis of the Popov explicit formula as the integrated Davenport series with the Riesz sum of order 1 subtracted. The Fourier expansion of the Davenport series is proved to be a consequence of the functional equation, which is referred to as the Davenport expansion. By the explicit formula for the Davenport series, we also prove that the Davenport expansion for the von Mangoldt function is equivalent to the Kummer’s Fourier series up to a formula of Ramanujan and a fortiori is equivalent to the functional equation for the Riemann zeta-function.},

As an example, we give two new proofs of the infinite product for the sine function depending on certain decompositions. We shall then prove some equivalent expressions for the functional equation, i.e. the partial fraction expansion and the integral expression involving the generating function for Bernoulli numbers. The equivalence of the infinite product for the sine functions and the partial fraction expansion for the hyperbolic cotangent function leads to a new proof of the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function.},

abstract={As has been pointed out by Chakraborty et al (Seeing the invisible: around generalized Kubert functions. Ann. Univ. Sci. Budapest. Sect. Comput. 47 (2018), 185–195), there have appeared many instances in which only the imaginary part—the odd part—of the Lerch zeta-function was considered by eliminating the real part. In this paper we shall make full use of (the boundary function aspect of) the q-expansion for the Lerch zeta-function, the boundary function being in the sense of Wintner (On Riemann’s fragment concerning elliptic modular functions. Amer. J. Math. 63 (1941), 628–634). We may thus refer to this as the ‘Fourier series–boundary q-series’, and we shall show that the decisive result of Yamamoto (Dirichlet series with periodic coefficients. Algebraic Number Theory. Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, 1977, pp. 275–289) on short character sums is its natural consequence. We shall also elucidate the aspect of generalized Euler constants as Laurent coefficients after a brief introduction of the discrete Fourier transform. These are rather remote consequences of the modular relation, i.e. the functional equation for the Lerch zeta-function or the polylogarithm function. That such a remote-looking subject as short character sums is, in the long run, also a consequence of the functional equation indicates the ubiquity and omnipotence of the Lerch zeta-function—and, a fortiori, the modular relation (S. Kanemitsu and H. Tsukada. Contributions to the Theory of Zeta-Functions: the Modular Relation Supremacy. World Scientific, Singapore, 2014).},

abstract={Boundary behavior of important functions has been an object of intensive research since the time of Riemann. Kurokawa, Kurokawa-Koyama, and Chapman studied the boundary behavior of generalized Eisenstein series which falls into this category. The underlying principle is the use of the Lipschitz summation formula. Our purpose is to show that it is a form of the functional equation for the Lipschitz-Lerch transcendent (and in the long run, it is equivalent to that for the Riemann zeta-function) and that this being indeed a boundary function of the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta-function, one can extract essential information. We also elucidate the relation between Ramanujan's formula and automorphy of Eisenstein series.},
