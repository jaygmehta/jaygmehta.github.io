	abstract={
	The popular RSA cryptosystem, based on the problem of integer factorization can widely be seen in practice even today. Since its inception, several enhancements and generalizations of RSA are proposed including its several multi-prime variants where the RSA modulus is a product of more than two primes. In this paper, we propose a generalized multi-moduli RSA cryptosystem (GMMRSA) which is a multi-prime RSA but with more than one modulus. We show that this multi-moduli approach yields a more secure cryptosystem than a multi-prime RSA with a single modulus without compromising its computational and time efficiencies.

	abstract={
	The Diffie-Hellman problem and the integer factorization problem are two major, well-known, and difficult problems in cryptography. In this paper, we propose a new cryptosystem based on these two problems, which is a hybrid of the Diffie-Hellman and RSA. We prove that the hybrid approach not only enhances the security of our proposed cryptosystem in comparison to RSA, but also provides an additional desirable attribute, namely the perfect forward secrecy.

	abstract={
	Several attacks on the well-known RSA cryptosystem that can be extended to a multi-prime version of RSA reveal that it is preferable to use the modulus having more prime factors. On the contrary, the larger the number of prime factors of the modulus, the greater the risk of its factorization. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the ``safest-value'' of the number of prime factors in a multi-prime RSA modulus and determine such safest-values for moduli of different sizes. By utilizing this concept, we propose an enhanced version of the Generalized Multi-Moduli RSA (GMMRSA).
