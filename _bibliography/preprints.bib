	abstract={
	The popular RSA cryptosystem, based on the problem of integer factorization can widely be seen in practice even today. Since its inception, several enhancements and generalizations of RSA are proposed including its several multi-prime variants where the RSA modulus is a product of more than two primes. In this paper, we propose a generalized multi-moduli RSA cryptosystem (GMMRSA) which is a multi-prime RSA but with more than one modulus. We show that this multi-moduli approach yields a more secure cryptosystem than a multi-prime RSA with a single modulus without compromising its computational and time efficiencies.

	abstract={
	The Diffie-Hellman problem and the integer factorization problem are two major, well-known, and difficult problems in cryptography. In this paper, we propose a new cryptosystem based on these two problems, which is a hybrid of the Diffie-Hellman and RSA. We prove that the hybrid approach not only enhances the security of our proposed cryptosystem in comparison to RSA, but also provides an additional desirable attribute, namely the perfect forward secrecy.

	abstract={
	In this paper, we propose an algorithm to efficiently retrieve the value of Euler's totient function of an RSA modulus, consequently voiding the RSA encryption. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster and more effective when the prime factors of an RSA modulus are closer to each other. We conjecture a relation between the difference of two prime factors of the RSA modulus and the required number of steps for the algorithm.

	In this paper, based on a multi-prime approach, we propose various variants of the RSA signature scheme. We will prove that a proposed variants of signature schemes are not only more secure than the standard multi-prime RSA scheme, but also they are computational and time efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior security of the multi-moduli signature scheme over any multi-prime signature scheme.
